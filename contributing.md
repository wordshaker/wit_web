### Who are Women In Tech Nottingham?

We are a group based in Nottingham that has the aim of building the Nottingham Tech community by encouraging
women in the feild to be part of it. We host monthly events including talks, activities and general socialising.
We have only female speakers at our events, but each one female attendee can bring a male friend. We are all
about celebrating women in tech and inclusivity. It is not our intension to exclude but to act as a gateway to 
get more women in tech to take part in other meetups and events.
